Currently, Punctaffy's hyperbracketed operations are prohibitively slow at parsing even small examples. The compiled code is fine, but even a small example can take several minutes to compile.

About 70% of the compile-time rigamarole seems attributable to defensive higher-order contract checking.  Since we can simply disable the contracts once we're confident in them, this isn't so concerning... but we might need to spend some time making it easier to disable these contracts, especially the more redundant ones.

Secondarily, we likely have a few too many traversals over hypersnippets. Each traversal over a hypersnippet involves doing several traversals over constituent hypersnippets of lower degree, so they can add up fast. There's likely to be some low-hanging fruit here; we might change the hypersnippet representations to avoid converting things back and forth and to give low-degree snippets some simpler internal representations that don't recur into hypersnippet after hypersnippet. In the long run, if we introduce parsing and template DSLs and use them everywhere, the optimization of the DSL implementation might take us a long way. Essentially, parsers and templates could together serve as higher-dimensional stream transducers, and they might be statically analyzable enough that we can perform stream fusion optimizations within the DSL.
